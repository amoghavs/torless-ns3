# torless-ns3

This is the repository of course project CSE-534, Spring 2017 semester. ToR and ToR-less networks have been simulated, adapted in parts from examples of NS3 simulator.

Code: 

tor-topology-2racks.cc # Code for ToR-networks
tor_matrix.txt # Links between nodes used for ToR-network
torless-topology-2racks.cc # Code for ToR-less networks
torless_matrix.txt # Links between nodes used for ToR-less network.
max-bandwidth-bw-nodes # Experiments to compute peak bandwidth.
